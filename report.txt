Problem name (KS, TSP, GC): TSP
Instance no: 4

Programming environment (operating system, programming languagae, IDE, ...):
Windows 8, Java, NetBeans

Approach used (e.g. dynamic programming, tabu search, custom heuristic, ...):
Nearest Neighbor Greedy Algorithm, 2-OPT Local Search with Simulated Anealing

Description of approach used (max 200 words):
At first program try to solve the problem with Nearest Neighbor Greedy Algorithm and then Start to search locally using 2-OPT operator. At each step we have
a random walk factor that let's our agent to take worsening steps. This factor decrease by each step and at least reach very close to zero.
